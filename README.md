# Projects
Hey! These are my projects

My first project is called DJaid:

It is a tool that helps match songs together using key, tempo, mode, and lyrics.
I used the the Spotipy library which uses the Spotify API to access data on songs, artists, albums, and other metrics.
I also used the LyricsGenius library that is a webscraper that accesses lyrics of songs.

The code mainly navigates through JSON outputs from the spotify, stores that data in dictionaries, and references the data in those dictionaries.
